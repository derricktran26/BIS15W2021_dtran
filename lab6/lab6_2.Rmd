## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Produce clear, concise summaries using a variety of functions in `dplyr` and `janitor.`  
2. Use the `across()` operator to produce summaries across multiple variables.  

## Breakout Rooms  
Please take 5-8 minutes to check over your answers to the HW in your group. If you are stuck, please remember that you can check the key in [Joel's repository](https://github.com/jmledford3115/BIS15LW2021_jledford).  

## Load the libraries
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
library("skimr")
library("palmerpenguins")
```

## Review
The summarize() and group_by() functions are powerful tools that we can use to produce clean summaries of data. Especially when used together, we can quickly group variables of interest and save time. Let's do some practice with the [palmerpenguins(https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) data to refresh our memory.
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

As biologists, a good question that we may ask is how do the measured variables differ by island (on average)?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarize(mean_body_mass_g=mean(body_mass_g),
            n=n())
```
when you have any NAs summary function will spit them back out as an NA. you can find the number of NAs by using a sum and a conditional
Why do we have NA here? Do all of these penguins lack data?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarize(number_NAs=sum(is.na(body_mass_g)))
```

Well, that won't work so let's remove the NAs and recalculate.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g)) %>% 
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarize(mean_body_mass_g=mean(body_mass_g),
            sd_body_mass_g=sd(body_mass_g),
            n=n())
```

What if we are interested in the number of observations (penguins) by species and island?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(island, species) %>% 
  summarize(n=n(), .groups= 'keep')#the .groups argument here just prevents a warning message
```

## Counts
Although these summary functions are super helpful, oftentimes we are mostly interested in counts. The [janitor package](https://garthtarr.github.io/meatR/janitor.html) does a lot with counts, but there are also functions that are part of dplyr that are useful.  

`count()` is an easy way of determining how many observations you have within a column. It acts like a combination of `group_by()` and `n()`.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(island, sort = T) #sort=T sorts the column in descending order
```

Compare this with `summarize()` and `group_by()`.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarize(n=n())
```

You can also use `count()` across multiple variables.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(island, species, sort = F)
```

For counts, I am starting to prefer `tabyl()`. Lots of options are supported in [tabyl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/tabyls.html)
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(species, island)
```

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(species, island) %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>%
  adorn_ns()
```

## Practice
1. Produce a summary of the mean for bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, and body_mass_g within Adelie penguins only. Be sure to provide the number of samples.(if you make something in sumarize its technically not a real varible, but you can base it off a real data column. also you have to be aware of NA and remove them with na.rm=T)
```{r}
penguins%>%
  select(species,bill_length_mm,bill_depth_mm,flipper_length_mm,body_mass_g)%>%
  filter(species=="Adelie")%>%
  summarise(mean_bill_length_mm=mean(bill_length_mm,na.rm=T),
            sd_bill_length_mm=sd(bill_length_mm,na.rm=T),
            n_samples=n())

```
```{r}
names(penguins)
```

2. How does the mean of `bill_length_mm` compare between penguin species?
```{r}
penguins%>%
  group_by(species)%>%
  summarise(mean_bill_length_mm=mean(bill_length_mm,na.rm=T))
```

3. For some penguins, their sex is listed as NA. Where do these penguins occur?
```{r}

```

## `across()`
Last time we had some great questions on how to use `filter()` and `select()` across multiple variables. There is a new function in dplyr called `across()` which is designed to work across multiple variables. Have a look at Rebecca Barter's awesome blog [here](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-07-09-across/) as I am following her below.  

What if we wanted to apply summarize in order to produce distinct counts over multiple variables; i.e. species, island, and sex? Although this isn't a lot of coding you can image that with a lot of variables it would be cumbersome.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(distinct_species = n_distinct(species),
            distinct_island = n_distinct(island),
            distinct_sex = n_distinct(sex))
```

By using `across()` a combination of columns we can reduce the clutter and make things cleaner. 
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(c(species, island, sex), n_distinct))
```

This is very helpful for continuous variables.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(contains("mm"), mean, na.rm=T))
```

`group_by` also works.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(across(contains("mm"), mean, na.rm=T))
```

Here we summarize across all variables.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarise_all(n_distinct)
```

Operators can also work, here I am summarizing `n_distinct()` across all variables except `species`, `island`, and `sex`.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarise(across(!c(species, island, sex), n_distinct))
```

All variables that include "bill"...all of the other dplyr operators also work.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarise(across(starts_with("bill"), n_distinct))
```

## Practice
1. Produce separate summaries of the mean and standard deviation for bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, and flipper_length_mm for each penguin species. Be sure to provide the number of samples.  
```{r}
penguins%>%
  group_by(species)%>%
  summarise(across(contains("mm"),mean,na.rm=T))
```
