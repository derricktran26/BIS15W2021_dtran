## What Are Loops?
A loop is a programming instruction that repeats until a specific condition is reached. Each time the code block within the loop is executed is called an iteration.
*Different Types of Loops:*
Depending on your specific programming situation, you may need different loop-structures that execute the code blocks within the loop on the basis of different conditions. The R programming language generally provides three different types of loops: 
1. Repeat-loops, 2. While-loops, 3. For-loops

## Repeat-Loops
Repeat-loops repeat a code block until a break condition is fulfilled. This break condition marks the end of the loop.
![Repeat-Loops](repeat-loop-in-r.png)

### Syntax of repeat loop
```{r,eval=FALSE}
repeat { 
   commands 
   if(condition) {
      break
   }
}
```

### example 0: Writing a repeat-Loop in R (Basics)
```{r}
x <- 0                 # Preliminary specification of data object
repeat{                # Head of repeat-loop
  x <- x + 1           # Body of repeat-loop
  print(x)
  if(x >= 10) {        # Break condition of repeat-loop
    break
  }
}
```

### example 1: repeat-Loop Through Columns of Data Frame
```{r}
data <- data.frame(x1 = 1:5,      # Create example data
                   x2 = 6:10,
                   x3 = 11:15)
data 

data1 <- data                   # Replicate example data i is used to indicate rounding index
i <- 1                          # Create running index
repeat{                         # Start repeat-loop
  data1[ , i] <- data1[ , i] + 100 #the brackets indicate row and column from a specific data frame, so taking i column and add 100 and add to it 
  i <- i + 1
  if(i > 2) {
    break
  }
}
data1
```

### Practice: Please write a repeat loop to change all numeric data from in centimeters to millimeters. run the repeat index first usually  
```{r}
#?iris
data(iris)                          # Loading data frame
head(iris)                          # Head of example data
iris1 <- iris                       # Replicate example data

i<-1
repeat{
  iris[,i]<- iris1[,1]*10
  i<-i+1
  if(!is.numeric(iris1[,i])){
    break
  }
}
```

```{r}
iris
```


## While-Loops
While-loops repeat a code block as long as a certain logical condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
![While-Loops](while-loop-in-r.png)

### Syntax of while loop
```{r,eval=FALSE}
while (test_expression) {
   statement
}
```

### example 0: Writing while-Loop in R (Basics)
```{r}
x <- 0                  # Preliminary specification of data object
while(x < 10) {         # Head of while-loop
  x <- x + 1            # Body of while-loop
  print(x)
}
```

### example 1: while-Loop Through Columns of Data Frame
```{r}
data2 <- data                       # Replicate example data
data2
i <- 1                              # Create running index
while(is.numeric(iris2[,1])) {
  iris2[,i<-iris2,i*10]
}                     # Start while-loop.the condition is that i is equal t
```

### Practice: Please write a while loop to change all numeric data from in centimeters to millimeters.
```{r}
head(iris)                                        # Showing head of data in RStudio console
iris2 <- iris                                     # Replicate example data
i<-i+1
while(i<=2{
  iris2[,i]<-iris2[,i]+100
  i<-i+1
})
iris2  
```

## For-Loops
For-loops specify a collection of objects (e.g. elements in a vector or list) to which a code block should be applied.
![For-Loops](for-loop-in-r.png)

### Syntax of for loop
```{r,eval=FALSE}
for (value in vector) {
   statements
}
```

### example 0: Loop Through Vector in R (Basics)
```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```

### example 1: For-Loop Through Columns of Data Frame
```{r}
data3 <- data                       # Replicate example data we only add to column 1 and 2 because of the for loop
data3
for(i in 1:2) {           # for-loop over columns
  data3[ , i] <- data3[ , i] + 100
}
data3
```

### Practice 1: Please write a for loop to change only width data from in centimeters to millimeters.
```{r}                                                 
head(iris)                                             # Inspecting iris flower data set
iris3 <- iris                                          # Replicate iris data set
```

### example 2: Looping over files
The simulated satellite collar data is downloaded from [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/data/locations.zip).
We can get the names of each of the files we want to loop over by using `list.files()`.
```{r}
data_files <- list.files("data/locations", pattern = "locations-2*", full.names = TRUE)
data_files
```

We would like to count the number of observations in each file.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create an empty vector to store those counts
results <- vector(mode = "integer", length = length(data_files))

for (i in 1:length(data_files)){
  data0 <- read_csv(data_files[i])
  count <- nrow(data0)
  results[i] <- count
}
results
```

### Practice 2: Storing loop results in a data frame
```{r}
# Start by creating an empty data frame
results <- data.frame(file_name = vector(mode = "character", length = length(data_files)),
                      count = vector(mode = "integer", length = length(data_files)))
```

### example 3: Looping over files for ggplot
Let’s use some satellite collar data on a number of different individuals and we want to be able to quickly look at all of their recent movements at once.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_files3 <- list.files("data/individual_collar_data", full.names = TRUE)
data_files3
# only ggplot
for (i in 1:length(data_files3)){
  data0 <- as.data.frame(read_csv(data_files3[i]))
  print(
    ggplot(data0, aes(x=long,y=lat))+
      geom_path()+
      geom_point()+
      labs(title = data_files3[i], x = "longitude", y = "latitude")
  )
}
# how to show them on a map?
```

### example 4: Looping over files for basic genetic analysis
[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) project is an open source software repository that hosts a wide range of statistical tools developed in the R programming environment. Please use standard R installation procedures to install the BiocManager package and then install "ShortRead" and "Biostrings". 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#     install.packages("BiocManager")
# BiocManager::install()                            # To install core packages or update installed packages
# BiocManager::install(c("ShortRead", "Biostrings"))# Install specific packages
library(ShortRead)
library(Biostrings)
```

The data is downloaded from [PATRIC, BACTERIAL BIOINFORMATICS RESOURCE CENTER](https://patricbrc.org/)
The first two lines load a .[fasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) file using the ShortRead package in Bioconductor. The second two lines determine the frequency of all of the bases in sequence and then calculate the GC content.
```{r}
reads <- readFasta("data/archaea-dna/a-saccharovorans.fasta")
seq <- sread(reads)
base_freq <- alphabetFrequency(seq)
gc_content <- (base_freq[1, "G"] + base_freq[1, "C"]) / sum(base_freq) * 100
gc_content
```

Then create a for loop that uses the above code to read in each sequence file and calculate it’s GC content. Store the resulting values in a data frame with one column with file names and a second column with GC contents.
```{r}
data_files2 <- list.files("data/archaea-dna")
data_files2

GC_results <- data.frame(file_name = vector(mode = "character", length = length(data_files2)),
                         gc_content = vector(mode = "integer", length = length(data_files2)))
```

## Packages for next time  
Please install packages below for part 2!  
```{r}
#install.packages("qtl")
#install.packages("qtlcharts")
```

## That's it! Take a break and I will see you on Zoom!
