Title: Tools, Shapefiles & Data to Work with an 'AlbersUSA' Composite Projection
Version: 0.4.1
Date: 2020-03-03
Author: Bob Rudis (bob@rud.is)
Maintainer: Bob Rudis <bob@rud.is>
Description: Creating a composite projection for states and counties of the United States
    that includes scaled and shifted polygons for Alaska and Hawaii is time consuming
    and potentially error-prone. Functions and data sets are provided to make it easier to
    produce maps with a composite projection. Furthermore, named projections for common
    transormations are provided to further increase mapping productivity.
