#' Cleaning history
#' 
#' * 2010: The first time I documented cleaning this dataset. I started with
#' delimited files I exported from Excel.
#' * 2014: I re-cleaned the data and (mostly) forced myself to pull it straight
#' out of the spreadsheets. Used the gdata package.
#' * 2015: I revisited the cleaning and switched to the readxl and readr
#' packages.
