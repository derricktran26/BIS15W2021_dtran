#' Cleaning history
#' 
#' * 2010: The first time I documented cleaning this dataset. I started with
#' delimited files I exported from Excel.
#' * 2014: I re-cleaned the data and (mostly) forced myself to pull it straight
#' out of the spreadsheets. Used the gdata package.
#' * 2015: I revisited the cleaning and switched to the readxl and readr
#' packages.

library(readxl)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

#' Extract the population data from the Excel file downloaded 2008-10-08 from
#' gapminder.org

#+ warning=FALSE
pop_xls <- read_excel("xls/gapdata003.xls")

## the DEFINEDNAME thing is described here
## https://github.com/hadley/readxl/issues/82#issuecomment-166767220
## also hiding a crapton of warnings due to variables seeming to be ... numeric
## and then having text in them --> ignore because I drop those variables
