## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Produce box plots using `ggplot.`  
2. Customize labels on axes using `labs` and `themes`.  
3. Use `color`, `fill`, and `group` to customize plots and improve overall aesthetics.  

## Review
Now that you have been introduced to `ggplot`, let's review the plot types from last week and learn how to manipulate their aesthetics to better suit our needs. Aesthetics make a significant difference, but you can take it too far so remember that the goal is to produce clean plots that are not distracting.

## Load the libraries
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

## Load the data
Let's revisit the mammal life history data to practice our ggplot skills. The [data](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/093/) are from: *S. K. Morgan Ernest. 2003. Life history characteristics of placental non-volant mammals. Ecology 84:3402.*
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
life_history <- read_csv(here("lab10", "data", "mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv")) %>% na_if("-999") %>% clean_names()
```

```{r}
glimpse(life_history)
```

## Bar Plots
Bar plots count the number of observations in a categorical variable.
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  count(order, sort=T)
```

```{r}
life_history %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=order)) + geom_bar()+coord_flip()
```

```{r}
life_history %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass=mean(mass, na.rm=T))
```

```{r}
options(scipen=999) #cancels scientific notation for the session
```

```{r}
life_history %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass=mean(mass, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=order, y=mean_mass))+geom_col()
```

```{r}
life_history %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass=mean(mass, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=order, y=mean_mass))+geom_col()+coord_flip()+scale_y_log10() #scales the axis
```

## Scatterplots
Scatter plots allow for comparisons of two continuous variables. lm is linear model
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=gestation, y=wean_mass)) + geom_point(na.rm=T) + scale_y_log10() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

## Boxplots
Box plots help us visualize a range of values. So, on the x-axis we typically have something categorical and the y-axis is the range.
```{r}
glimpse(life_history)
```

```{r}
life_history %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=order, y=mass))+geom_boxplot()+scale_y_log10()+coord_flip()
```

Remember, you can always use dplyr functions to focus your question, summarize, etc.
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  filter(order=="Primates") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=family, y=mass))+geom_boxplot(na.rm=T)+scale_y_log10()+coord_flip()
```

## Practice  
For this practice, let's go back to the elephants data from midterm 1. Maybe we can make our midterm answers "pop" with some nice plots!
```{r}
elephants <- read_csv(here("lab10", "data", "ElephantsMF.csv")) %>% clean_names()
```

1. On midterm 1, I asked how many male and female elephants were represented in the data. How would you make a plot of this?
```{r}
names(elephants)
```
```{r}
elephants%>%
  count(sex)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sex))+
  geom_bar()
```

2. How does the age of elephants compare by sex?
```{r}
elephants%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sex,y=age))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

3. What is the relationship between age and height?
```{r}

```

## Aesthetics: Labels
Now that we have practiced scatter plots, bar plots, and box plots we need to learn how to adjust their appearance to suit our needs. Let's start with labeling x and y axes.  

In the example above we looked at age and height of elephants. se is the confidence intervals showing
```{r}
elephants %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=height)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=F)
```

The plot looks clean, but it is incomplete. A reader unfamiliar with the data might have a difficult time interpreting the labels. To add custom labels, we use the `labs` command.
```{r}
elephants %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=height)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=F)+
  labs(title="Elephant Age vs. Height",
       x="Age",
       y="Height (cm)")
```

We can improve the plot further by adjusting the size and face of the text. We do this using `theme()`.
```{r}
elephants %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=height)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=F) +
  labs(title = "Elephant Age vs. Height",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Height") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10))
```

The `rel()` option changes the relative size of the title to keep things consistent. Adding `hjust` allows control of title position.
```{r}
elephants %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=height)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=F) +
  labs(title = "Elephant Age vs. Height",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Height") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```

## Other Aesthetics
There are lots of options for aesthetics. An aesthetic can be assigned to either numeric or categorical data. `fill` is a common grouping option; notice that an appropriate key is displayed when you use one of these options.
```{r}
elephants %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sex, fill=sex))+geom_bar()+
  labs(title = "# Elephants by Sex",
       x = "Sex",
       y = NULL) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```

`size` adjusts the size of points relative to a continuous variable. size = mass here is to scale
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=gestation, y=log10(mass), size=mass))+
  geom_point(na.rm=T)
```

```{r}
life_history %>% 
  filter(gestation>20)
```

## Practice
Let's end today's lab by looking at the homerange data. By now, these should be very familiar to you.
```{r}
homerange <- read_csv(here("lab10", "data", "Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv"))
```

```{r}
names(homerange)
```

1. Make a barplot that shows counts of ectotherms and endotherms. Label the axes, provide a title, and fill by `thermoregulation`.
```{r}
homerange%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=thermoregulation,fill=thermoregulation))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(title="#Taxa by thermoregulation",
       x="Thermoregulation",
       y="n")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
  
```

2. Make a scatterplot that compares log10.mass and homerange. Adjust the size of points by mass. Label the axes and provide a title.size thing changes the size of the dot by how much is there, but if you write it in the same line as aesthetic you can adjust size of dot according to number otherwise it will adjust actual size in geom point
```{r}
homerange%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=log10.mass,y=log10.hra))+
  geom_point(size=1.5)+
  labs(title="Mass vs Homerange",
       x="Log10 Mass",
       y="Log10.HRA")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```

## That's it! Take a break and I will see you on Zoom!
