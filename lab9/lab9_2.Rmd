## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Produce boxplots using `ggplot.`  
2. Customize labels on axes using `labs` and `themes`.  
3. Use `color`, `fill`, and `group` to customize plots and improve overall aesthetics.  

## Breakout Rooms  
Please take 5-8 minutes to check over your answers to HW 8 in your group. If you are stuck, please remember that you can check the key in [Joel's repository](https://github.com/jmledford3115/BIS15LW2021_jledford).

## Review
Now that you have been introduced to `ggplot`, let's practice a few more plot types. Remember that plots are built in layers: **plot= data + geom_ + aesthetics**. We have to specify each of these in order for a plot to be produced. If you get stuck, it is often helpful to stop and make a quick sketch of what you want or expect to see on a piece of scratch paper.  

Let's review using the `penguins` data. First, get an idea of the structure: Are the data tidy? Are there NA's? Are the variables discrete, categorical, or continuous?
```{r}
#penguins<-penguins
  
```

In a previous lab, we asked how many penguins are on each island.
```{r}
penguins %>% count(island, species, sort = F)
```

What if we wanted a plot that showed the number of measured penguins per species and the number of measured penguins per island? if we wanted to just count things straight up bar is your function to use
```{r}
penguins%>%
  group_by(island)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=species))+
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}

```

How about average bill length by sex?
```{r}
penguins%>%
  count(sex != NA)
```

```{r}
penguins%>%
  count(sex!="NA")%>%
  group_by(sex)%>%
  summarise(ave_bill_length=mean(bill_length_mm))
```

## Box Plots
For the next series of examples, we will use the `homerange` data.  **Database of vertebrate home range sizes.**   

Reference: Tamburello N, Cote IM, Dulvy NK (2015) Energy and the scaling of animal space use. The American Naturalist 186(2):196-211. http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/682070.  
Data: http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q5j65/1  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
homerange <- read_csv(here("lab9", "data", "Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv"))
homerange
```

Boxplots help us visualize a range of values. So, on the x-axis we typically have something categorical and the y-axis is the range. In the case below, we are plotting `log10.mass` by taxonomic class in the `homerange` data. `geom_boxplot()` is the geom type for a standard box plot. The center line in each box represents the median, not the mean.

Let's look at the variable `log10.mass` grouped by taxonomic class.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarize(min_log10.mass=min(log10.mass),
            max_log10.mass=max(log10.mass),
            median_log10.mass=median(log10.mass))
```

```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = log10.mass)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Practice
1. There are more herbivores than carnivores in the homerange data, but how do their masses compare? Make a summary and boxplot that compares their masses. Use `log10.mass`.
```{r}
names(homerange)
```

```{r}
homerange%>%
  select(trophic.guild,log10.mass)%>%
  filter(log10.mass>0)%>%
  group_by(trophic.guild)%>%
  summarise(avg_mass=mean(log10.mass,na.rm=T))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=trophic.guild,y=avg_mass))+geom_col()
```
```{r}
homerange%>%
  select(trophic.guild,log10.mass)%>%
  count(trophic.guild,log10.mass)
```

2. Have a closer look at carnivorous mammals. Summarize and visualize the range of log10.mass by family.

```{r}

```


```{r}
homerange%>%
  select(family, log10.mass,trophic.guild,class)%>%
  filter(class=="mammalia", trophic.guild=="carnivore")%>%
  group_by(family)%>%
  summarise(avg_mass=mean(log10.mass,na.rm=T),
            med_log_10_mass=median(log10.mass,na.rm = T),
            max_mass=max(log10.mass))
            
```

3. Now use a boxplot to visualize the range of body mass by family of carnivore.
```{r}

```

## That's it, let's take a break!
